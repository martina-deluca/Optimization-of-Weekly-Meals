# Optimization-of-Weekly-Meals

The objective of this project was to find daily recipes for users throughout the week by taking into account multiple dietary restrictions and user preferences, while minimizing the cost.

This repository includes the Python Notebook with the code implementation, the source files and the report submitted for the assignment.
Source files are:
 - recipes.csv: Main source file including ~20K recipes and the information for each one.
 - recipe_prices.csv: File that contains the calculated price for the recipes.
 - update_meal_type.csv: Auxiliary file to add meal types to most recipes that had the field blank.
